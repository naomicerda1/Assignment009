        <li>What worked well for me over the last 9 weeks that helped in my learning process is looking over the power points and taking as much notes as possible so I could go back and review when needed.</li>
        <li>There is nothing I would change about the course.</li>
        <li>When entering this course, I had some what of an idea of what I was getting into because of the fact I took the into to HTML and CSS prior. I expected to learn so much, which I did. But I was excited to broaden my creativity when it came to creating a style sheet and I believe it was accomplished.</li>
        <li>Some concepts that were new to me were the RGBA and HSLA Values, box-sizing and box-model. Some concepts I had already encountered from the prior class would be how to link a style sheet to the html page. As well as different ways to align text.</li>
